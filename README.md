# Password-Generator
A client request to improve security to sensitive company data. The request is for a password generator that randomly chooses characters based on criteria the user inputs such as length, uppercas or lower case, etc.

In order to satisfy the request I will need to meet this criteria:

- [x] When prompted for character types to include in the password, user can a choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
- [x] All user inputs by prompt will be validated
- [x] At least one character type must be chosen after all prompts run
- [x] Password is generated based of criteria selected
